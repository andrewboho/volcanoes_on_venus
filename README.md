This repository is organized as follows:

1. final_notebook.ipynb - The complete project
2. results - a directory with algorithm results outputted to JSON files used to maintain a model performance scoreboard
3. final_model.json and final_model.h5 files - the fully trained model structure and weights
4. project_utils.py - and ad-hoc library with home-spun functions used in this project

The data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fmena14/volcanoesvenus/home).
